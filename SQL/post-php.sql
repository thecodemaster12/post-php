However, exposures to various pollutants remain high in much of South Asia, and the data brings into focus the need for sustained and science-based local and regional action to improve air quality,&quot; said Pant, who oversaw the report&#039;s release.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a silver lining with the stabilisation and even reduction of annual average PM2.5 levels of air pollutants at the national level, another threat looms large: ozone pollution, according to the report.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, this year&#039;s report includes exposure levels and related health effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), including the impact of NO2 exposures on the development of childhood asthma.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, deaths linked to exposure to ozone have more than doubled, with 15,000 deaths in 2021 compared with 6,200 deaths in 2000.\r\n\r\nTraffic exhaust is a major source of NO2, which means densely populated urban areas, particularly in high-income countries, often see the highest levels of NO2 exposure and health impacts.', 18, '2024-06-19 14:07:19', 1),

Because common people do not have as much money this year, a target to collect 80 lakh pieces of rawhides has been set,&quot; he said.\r\n\r\nThe modest target was set despite a record number of sacrificial animals being put up for sale this Eid-ul-Azha due to a surplus in supply as many were left unsold during last year&#039;s Eid, he said.\r\n\r\nThere were over 1.25 crore sacrificial animals in 2023, but the number has crossed 1.29 crore this year, as per data from the Department of Livestock Services.\r\n\r\nAhamed added that sales of leather products had decreased considerably in the local market due to high inflation. The same applied to the international market, he said.\r\n\r\n&quot;These are fashionable products. Given the situation, people will buy fashionable products only after buying essential products. That&#039;s normal. Because of this, both buyers and traders are in a tight situation,&quot; he said.\r\n\r\nThe economic situation of countries which collect leather from Bangladesh is also not good. They are also going through high inflationary pressure and various economic crises. So, they have reduced order quantities, he said.\r\n\r\nDue to these reasons, the target of rawhide collection has been reduced this year, he added.\r\n\r\nDuring the July-May period of the current fiscal year, exports of leather goods totalled $961 million, marking a decline of 14.17 percent compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, the government set the price of salt-cured cowhides at Tk 55-60 per square foot (sqft) in the capital and Tk 50-55 per sqft outside the capital.\r\n\r\nLast year, the price was Tk 50-55 per sqft in Dhaka and Tk 47-52 per sqft outside the capital.\r\n\r\n&quot;Even three to four years ago, we did not buy so many rawhides. But it was found that middlemen make profits of over Tk 300 per piece, which affects the market,&quot; Ahamed said, adding that tannery owners were interested in buying rawhides in order to keep the market stable.\r\n\r\n&quot;We now directly contact madrasas and orphanages in advance. Later we give them the price of the rawhides according to the market price,&quot; he said.\r\n\r\nTanners will get about Tk 270 crore in loans from banks to procure and preserve rawhides during the upcoming Eid-ul-Adha.\r\n\r\nLast year, traders sought loans of around Tk 500 crore but received Tk 259 crore.
